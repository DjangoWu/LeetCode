Follow up for &quot;Remove Duplicates&quot;:
What if duplicates are allowed at most twice?

For example,
Given sorted array nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3. It doesn&#39;t matter what you leave beyond the new length.
